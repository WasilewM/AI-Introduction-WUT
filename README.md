# AI-Introduction-WUT
Code in this repository was written during Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course of my computer science studies at WUT.\n
In this repository I only upload finished code, due to the fact that I do work with the gitlab repository of the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology on a daily basis.\n

Task "lab 1" - gradient descent - write code that finds a local minimum of 2 hardcoded functions.\n
